Testing:
Value of Rosenbrock(0,0) = 
1
Gradient of Rosenbrock(0,0) =

Hessian of Rosenbrock(0,0) = 
|2, 0,   |
|-0.0244141, 200,   |
Minimum of Rosenbrock(0,0):

Value of Himmelblau(0,0) =

Gradient of Himmelblau(0,0) = 
|-14, -22,   |
Hessian of Himmelblau(0,0) = 
|-42, 0,   |
|0, -26,   |
Minimum of Himmelblau(0,0): 
Oh no it didn't converge! :|
Steps taken: 1001
|-2.48854e-06, -6.31698e-06,   |
Himmelblau(minimum) = 170
This isn't a correct minimum of the Himmelblau function.
My algorithm does, however, find a correct minimum if the starting point is better:
Minimum of Himmelblau(2,3): 
Steps taken: 5
|3, 2,   |
Himmelblau(minimum) = 3.42975e-14
Oh no it didn't converge! :|
Steps taken: 1001
D = 38015.9
With parameters m,Γ,A = |127.222, 7.04442, 21.565,   |
Guess by inspection: D = 31781.7
With parameters m,Γ,A = |126, 3, 14,   |
So maybe my minimization algorithm isn't the best at finding such difficult minima :(
